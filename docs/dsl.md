### Random ideas
 - Broadcast, I take tips!
 - Give users Tip suggestions
 - When tipping, send directly to other person.

### Issues
 - Sender doesn't have account or money
 - Sender's tips accumulates, if send doesn't claim, goes back to tipper
 - Recipient sees sender's tweet, thinks wtf?
 - Recipient sees
